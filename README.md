# 🌍 Corporate Carbon Footprint Tracker

**Theme:** Environment Data Analytics (EDA)  
**Task ID:** EDA-1  
**Program:** M.Tech (Computer Science)  
**Institute:** International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur (IIIT-NR)  
**Execution Platform:** Google Colab

## 📖 About the Project

The **Corporate Carbon Footprint Tracker** is an academic Environment Data Analytics project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project studies emissions across **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3**, enabling a comprehensive understanding of how corporate activities impact the environment.

Using **Python and Google Colab**, this project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and insights from emission datasets. The project aligns strictly with **Theme 2: Environment Data Analytics (EDA)** and **Task EDA-1**.

## 🌱 Why this Project is Important

- Climate change mitigation requires accurate emission analysis  
- Corporations are major contributors to global carbon emissions  
- Understanding Scope-wise emissions helps in targeted reduction strategies  
- Demonstrates real-world application of **data analytics for sustainability**  
- Useful for **academic learning, research, and policy understanding**

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Core Objective
- To analyze corporate carbon emission data covering **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions**.

### Data Analytics Objectives
- Classify companies based on **carbon intensity** (Low / Medium / High)  
- Perform **year-wise trend analysis** of emissions  
- Study the contribution of different emission scopes  
- Conceptually compare **actual emission trends vs pledged reductions**  
- Generate insights using data visualization techniques  

---

## 📊 What the Project Does (Functionality)

- Loads corporate emission dataset into **Google Colab**
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handles missing values and verifies data types
- Detects and analyzes outliers
- Generates visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Line plots
  - Bar charts
- Interprets results and summarizes insights
